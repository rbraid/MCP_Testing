# MCP Testing Project - Final Report

## Project Summary
The MCP_Testing project was created to test MCP servers using Rust. We've established a basic structure for monitoring and reporting server status.

## Components Created

1. **Library (lib.rs)**
   - Implemented `MCPServer` struct for representation of MCP servers
   - Created `ServerStatus` enum for server states (Online, Offline, Degraded, Unknown)
   - Implemented methods for status checking and description formatting
   - Added unit tests for all functionality

2. **Binary (main.rs)**
   - Created a simple command-line interface to display MCP server statuses
   - Used the library components to check multiple simulated servers

3. **Integration Tests**
   - Added tests directory with integration tests
   - Mirrored the unit tests to verify library functionality

4. **Project Configuration**
   - Set up Cargo.toml for both library and binary targets
   - Added rustfmt configuration for consistent formatting
   - Created .gitignore for Rust projects

## Build Process

1. Successfully built the project with `cargo build`
2. Ran clippy to check for code quality issues (none found)
3. Applied rustfmt configuration for consistent code style

## Issues Encountered

1. **Test Recognition**
   - Despite proper configuration, the test runner was not recognizing our tests
   - Created debug scripts to try to troubleshoot the issue
   - This might be due to environment configuration limitations

## Next Steps

1. **Test Fixes**
   - Continue troubleshooting test recognition issues
   - Consider alternative testing strategies if necessary

2. **Enhancements**
   - Implement actual network connectivity checks for real MCP servers
   - Add detailed reporting functionality
   - Consider adding a configuration file for server definitions

3. **Release Preparation**
   - Once tests are working, prepare for release with proper versioning
   - Add more comprehensive documentation

## Repository

The project has been successfully committed to GitHub at rbraid/MCP_Testing.
